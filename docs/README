lab: zero point five - raw socket communication

This lab demonstrates and allows you to work with raw (basic) socket 
communication. When we think about communication, certainly client-server 
concepts, technologies like web services, the web, email, DBMS, etc. 
are examples most often brought up. Others that we may not associate 
with this type of point-to-point communication are NFS, map-reduce 
frameworks, web frameworks, networks, and devices.

So, why is this lab important? As hinted above, communication (messaging) 
is core to all client-servers. It doesn't matter what abstractions are built 
upon it to hide this interaction - It's there.

Codewise, look at and explore:

   1. connection management (lifecycle)
   2. message content - header and payload

Grey matter, looking deeper:

   1. weaknesses - how to harden this code
   2. measuring and changing performance, throughput
   3. how does it scale?
